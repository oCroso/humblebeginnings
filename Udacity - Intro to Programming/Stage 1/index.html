		<h3>HTML</h3>

			HTML is the structure from which pages are built.<br> 
			You can use it to lay out the box strucutre that contains the different elements of your page.<br>
			Web pages like Wikipedia are great examples of pages with deep layers of html strucutre.<br>
			You use div to

		<h3>CSS</h3>
		<div class="textsection">
			<p>
			CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to apply the "decoration" or design to your webpage.<br>
			You can think of HTML like the Home, and CSS like the interior decorator.<br>
			If I want to change the color of the background, create shapes, define the size of elements, etc,<br>
			I can use my CSS to do so.<br>
			A great example of how you can us CSS is:
			<div class="codeexample"
			<p>
			h1 {<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;background-color : black;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: white;<br>
			}
			</p>
			</div><br><br>
			Here we see that all elements labeled h1 will now have a black background with white text. <br>
			But you can also specify a class using class tags. For example:<br><br>
			<div class="codeexample"
			<p>
			.yourclassname {<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;background-color : black;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: white;<br>
			}
			</p>
			</div><br><br>
			Now, anything referenced by your html as belonging to the class .yourclassname will have<br>
			the settings that h1 previously had.
