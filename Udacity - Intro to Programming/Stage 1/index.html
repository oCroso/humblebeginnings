					<!---Displaying the uses of the paragraph tag-->
					<p>
					Im going to use the paragraph tag here to show the usage of the paragraph!
					</p>
					<!--This is making an invisible box around the text.-->
					<p>
					This is also using the paragraph tag to display the spacing differences (I'm in a box!)
					</p>
		
					<!---Understanding inline vs block examples-->
					<span>
					this is a line showing span which acts like inline text. Strangely it seems to ignore my break at the end...<br>
					</span>
					Inline <strong>example</strong> for sure.<br><br><br>
					<footer>
					I hope you enjoyed!

				<em>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</em> is the structure from which pages are built. 
				You can use it to lay out the box strucutre that contains the different elements of your page.
				Web pages like Wikipedia are great examples of pages with deep layers of html strucutre.
				You use div to divide up the page into multiple blocks that you use for the structure!

				<em>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</em> are used to apply the "decoration" or design to your webpage.
				You can think of HTML like the Home, and CSS like the interior decorator.
				If I want to change the color of the background, create shapes, define the size of elements, etc,
				I can use my CSS to do so. A great example of how you can use CSS is:
				<div class="codeexample"
				<p>
				h1 {<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;background-color : black;<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: white;<br>
				}
				</p>
				</div><br><br>
				Here we see that all elements labeled h1 will now have a black background with white text.
				But you can also specify a class using class tags. For example:<br><br>
				<div class="codeexample"
				<p>
				.yourclassname {<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;background-color : black;<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;color: white;<br>
				}
				</p>
				</div><br><br>
				Now, anything referenced by your html as belonging to the class .yourclassname will have
				the settings that h1 previously had.<br><br>
