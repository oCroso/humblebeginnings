    <!---Displaying the uses of the paragraph tag-->
    <p>
      Im going to use the paragraph tag here to show the usage of the paragraph!
    </p>
    <!--This is making an invisible box around the text.-->
    <p>
      This is also using the paragraph tag to display the spacing differences (I'm in a box!)
    </p>

    <!---Understanding inline vs block examples-->
    <span>
      this is a line showing span which acts like inline text. Strangely it seems to ignore my break at the end...<br>
    </span>
    <div>
      this is showing div, which acts like the paragraph tag (supposedly, I have been unable to get this to display as a box)
    </div><br>
    Inline <strong>example</strong> for sure.<br><br><br>
    <footer>
      I hope you enjoyed!
